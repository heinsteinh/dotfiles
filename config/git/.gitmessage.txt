#
# Types:
# feat: A new feature
# fix: A bug fix
# docs: Documentation only changes
# style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
# refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# perf: A code change that improves performance
# test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
# build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
# ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
# chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
# revert: Reverts a previous commit
#
# Scope: The scope should be the name of the npm package affected
#
# Subject: The subject contains a succinct description of the change:
# - Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
# - Don't capitalize the first letter
# - No dot (.) at the end
#
# Body: Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense.
# The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this
# with previous behavior.
#
# Footer: The footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes
# and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit Closes.
#
# Breaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space
# or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
